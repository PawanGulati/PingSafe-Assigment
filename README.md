### Introduction

The Folder Path Generator is a frontend project developed using ReactJS and MUI (Material-UI). It provides a visual representation of a file system where folders and files are displayed in a nested manner. The project allows users to select and deselect folders and files, with recursive selection and deselection capabilities. The selection state of child elements affects the state of their parent folders, and this effect is recursively propagated up to the root folder.

The project is designed to simulate a tree or graph-based problem, where the hierarchical relationship between folders and files is crucial. It is responsive and can be accessed on different devices. The application is deployed on Netlify for easy access and sharing.

### Approach

Basic approach towards this problem is DFS(Depth First Search) in graphical traversal terms. Here we recursively check if the children files or folders are checked or not, or if we check the item we recursively make all its child checked.

Main dataset schema:

2 State maintained: checked & intermediate

#### Main project state:

#### Events: 
handleChecked()

This event in itself consist of 2 events which recursively traverse parent and children to check or uncheck them depending upon state of current item.
Those 2 handlers are: _handleChecked() & _handleAllCheck()

_handleChecked(): This function is been passed a copy of main state, we map on this state and see if any items among first level matches the id, if not then do this thing recursively for folders on that level.

_handleAllCheck(): This function checks all the descendants to it if it is been checked or uncheck on vice versa.

handleSubmit()

This event is kept on submit button, where this just checks the tree selected and print each and every path to file selected.

handleReset()

This event is kept on reset button, it clears the directory tree and paths shown screen, letting user to checking and unchecking files and folder again.

#### Path generation:
Path is generated by doing a simple dfs over the main state, we build a path string as we move forward recusively and encounter files which are checked.

### More to it!!!

1. I have made a server in NodeJs, which fetches files and folders from a target folder, now instead of having those datasets manually hardcoded provided we can do this and target a particular folder, it will automatically pick up that structure and reflect it on screen.
2. We could have also do some opening and closing of folders with simultaneous checking and unchecking of it. This will make our directory tree more cleaner and easier to use.
3. With the path to the folder we could have also provided the links to the files too.
